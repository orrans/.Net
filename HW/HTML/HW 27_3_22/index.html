      <h2>Civil law:</h2>
      <p>
        Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world
        today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are,
        primarily, legislation—especially codifications in constitutions or
        statutes passed by government—and custom.[83] Codifications date back
        millennia, with one early example being the Babylonian Codex Hammurabi.
        Modern civil law systems essentially derive from legal codes issued by
        Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century, which were
        rediscovered by 11th century Italy.[84] Roman law in the days of the
        Roman Republic and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a
        professional legal class.[85] Instead a lay magistrate, iudex, was
        chosen to adjudicate. Decisions were not published in any systematic
        way, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost
        unrecognised.[86] Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of
        the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges'
        decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529 to 534
        AD the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I codified and consolidated Roman law
        up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass
        of legal texts from before.[87] This became known as the Corpus Juris
        Civilis. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked
        back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak
        it had reached three centuries before."[88] The Justinian Code remained
        in force in the East until the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Western
        Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the Theodosian Code and Germanic
        customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th
        century, and scholars at the University of Bologna used it to interpret
        their own laws.[89] Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law,
        alongside some influences from religious laws such as canon law,
        continued to spread throughout Europe until the Enlightenment; then, in
        the 19th century, both France, with the Code Civil, and Germany, with
        the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, modernised their legal codes. Both these
        codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in
        continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the Japanese and Korean legal
        traditions.[90][91] Today, countries that have civil law systems range
        from Russia] and Turkey to most of Central and Latin America.[92]

            Law is a system of rules created and enforced through social or
            governmental institutions to regulate behavior,[2] with its precise
            definition a matter of longstanding debate.

            Legal systems vary between countries, with their differences
            analysed in comparative law. In civil law jurisdictions, a
            legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law.

            aw's scope can be divided into two domains. Public law concerns
            government and society, including constitutional law, administrative
            law, and criminal law. Private law deals with legal disputes between
            individuals and/or organisations.

            There have been several attempts to produce "a universally
            acceptable definition of law". In 1972, Baron Hampstead suggested
            that no such definition could be produced.[30] McCoubrey and White.

            Definitions of law often raise the question of the extent to which
            law incorporates morality.[42] John Austin's utilitarian answer was
            that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions.

            Hugo Grotius, the founder of a purely rationalistic system of
            natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as
            Aristotle had indicated—and reason.[45] Immanuel Kant believed a
            moral imperative requires laws
